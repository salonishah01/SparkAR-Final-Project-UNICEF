# SparkAR-Final-Project-UNICEF

As a part of the SparkAR Open Program by The School Of Innovation From Facebook, this is the final Capstone Project completed under the Theme Partner UNICEF.
The filter was created for instagram users, wherein the filter was designed to bring out the importance of wearing a mask during Corona Pandemic (As this was one of the precautionary measure).


More of the functionality of the filter:
When an open mouth is detected, a message that the user is unsafe is displayed and some 3d objects resembling coronavirus are animated to pop out of user's mouth.
When mouth is closed, a mask appears over user's mouth and a message of user being safe is displayed.
